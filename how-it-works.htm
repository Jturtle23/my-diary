			<h2>How to Use</h2>
			
			<p>
			<strong>My Diary</strong> is a browser-based personal diary for writing your own diary entries. No need 
			to sign up; all of your data is stored directly within your browser!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Using My Diary is easy!
			
			<ol>
				<li>Add a date and subject to your entry.</li>
				<li>Write your entry in the text box.</li>
				<li>Click the "Add Entry" button underneath the text box.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			To read past entries, go to the bottom of the page, where there is a chart of all of your saved entries. 
			To read an entry, click on the date of the entry you want to read. You will be taken to a page to view
			your entry. On this page, you can edit your entry with the "Edit Entry" button. This might be useful for:
			fixing painful typos, adding some P.S. thoughts, or, my favorite, adding a note from a later date
			reflecting on an old entry.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			What do you write in a diary? Well, there isn't a right answer. Everyone's diary is different. Someone
			might mostly write about events in their life or things they want to remember while others may focus mostly
			on self-reflection and talking about their feelings. Some may do both! It's completely up to you.
			</p>
			
			<h2>About</h2>
			
			<p>
			My Diary was made by <a href="https://github.com/Jturtle23">Jturtle23</a> and uploaded to GitHub in 
			September 2024. It is made with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; no libraries. Your data, including the
			content of your entries, is saved locally to your browser. And don't worry&mdash;nobody else can see what 
			you write. I made this website to learn about local storage and how to use it. I hope to add more features
			to this app later on.
